# A story about volcanoes

In this report we go a little bit back in time and present a story about volcanoes…

I mean, who hasn’t seen at least one presentation by a classmate on volcanoes in primary school?

In this final report of course 2 we would like you to tell us data-driven a story about volcanoes and/or volcanic eruptions, illustrated with data and data visualisations. We will point you to some data resources, but you are free to use other sources as well.

In this report, we are not so much interested in seeing your data wrangling and code to create visualisations, as that we are interested in a clearly communicated story / stories surrounding this topic. A story that is presented in a well-formatted Rmarkdown report, accompanied by high quality data visualisations, created in R.

You have a lot of freedom here, but we have specified some requirements below.

## Data Source

The idea for this project is inspired by the Tidy Tuesday project, who ran an episode on volcanic data. The data that they used can be found here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-05-12/readme.md, and we recommend you use this data as a starting point. However, as already said, if you have access to other data related to volcanoes and volcanic activity, you are free to use that too.

## Requirements for the report

A beautifully styled R markdown document
As mentioned, the focus in the report should be on the story, not on the code. So although we are asking you to create the data visualisations with R, the focus of the report should not be on the code, but on the output. In fact, we recommend you hide the code, or only make it appear if the user wants to see it, for example by clicking a button.

Use a custom theme for this document. It can be a theme you designed yourself, but also a pre-packaged theme, as long as it is not the default theme.

## data-driven report

Because the story needs to be data-driven, we require that there are at least five visualisations included, and at least one of these should be complemented with a table that is created using one of the packages discussed in this course (e.g. {DT}, {KableExtra}, etc.).

Note that not all these visualisations need to be the end point to a story. You could also include visualisations that helped you explore the data, to introduce your audience to the data for example.

## Format

The format of the report is up to you. HTML is often a nice format for custom themed Rmarkdown documents, but if a different format works better for you, that is fine too.
